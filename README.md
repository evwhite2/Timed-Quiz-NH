# Timed-Quiz-NH

QuiTest your knowledge of natural science and human history!

This timed quiz was built using vanilla JavaScript. 

An interval is set to count down "timeLeft" every second, Once the "timeLeft" variable reaches 0, the next question is called by incrementing the "qCount", which is set the first index in the array of "questions".

Once the qCount completes the lenght of itself, "scoreKeeper()" is called.
